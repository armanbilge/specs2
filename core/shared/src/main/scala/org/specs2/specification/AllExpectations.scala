  *
  * All the results are collected into a list, provided by the StoredExpectations trait. These results form then the
  * body of the each example (decorated by a special ExampleFactory) so that each example returns a Result which is the
  * summary of all the individual issues.
  *
  * It must be noted that this trait relies on a mutable list to collect the results as they are created in the example
  * body. Because of this restriction, a Specification using that trait must run sequentially
