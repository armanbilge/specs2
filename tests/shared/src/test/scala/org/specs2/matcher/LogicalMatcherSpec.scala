Not matches
===========

A matcher can be negated
  in the pure case                    $not1
  in the case of a thrown expectation $not2


Or matches
==========

 A matcher can be or-ed with another one
   if both matches are ok the result is ok                                                        $or1
   if both matches are ko the result is ko                                                        $or2
   if the first matcher is ok, the second one is not evaluated                                    $or3
   if both matchers are ko the combination is ko                                                  $or4
   if the first matcher is ko, and the second ok, the combination is ok                           $or5
   if the matchers throw exceptions the combination must be a success when 'failure' or 'success' $or6

 it is possible also to 'or' 2 match expressions
   if the first is ok, the result is ok                                                           $or7
   if the first is not ok, the second is not evaluated                                            $or8
   ko and ok and ko is ok                                                                         $or9

 or must deal with exceptions
    { throw e; 1 } must m1 or throwAn[Exception]                                                  $or10
    { throw e; 1 } must throwAn[Exception] or m1                                                  $or11
    { 1          } must m1 or throwAn[Exception]                                                  $or12
    { 1          } must throwAn[Exception] or m1                                                  $or13
    { throw E2; 1 } must m1 or throwAn[E2] or throwAn[E1]                                         $or14

And matches
===========

 a matcher can be and-ed with another one
   if both matches are ok the result is ok                                                        $and1

 it is possible also to 'and' 2 match expressions
   if both matches are ok the result is ok                                                        $and2
   if the first is not ok, the second is not evaluated                                            $and3
   ok and ko and ok is ko                                                                         $and4

Succeed or skip, or pending
===========================

 a matcher can be ok or be skipped
   if it is ok, it returns a Success result                                                       $skip1
   if it is ko, it returns a Skipped result                                                       $skip2
   if it throws an exception, it returns a Skipped result                                         $skip3
   a skipped message can also be added in front of the failure message                            $skip4

 a matcher can be ok or be pending
   if it is ok, it returns a Success result                                                       $pending1
   if it is ko, it returns a Pending result                                                       $pending2
   if it throws an exception, it returns a Pending result                                         $pending3
   a pending message can also be added in front of the failure message                            $pending4

Conditions
==========

 a matcher can applied only if a boolean condition is true
   if the condition is true, it is applied                                                        $conditions1
   if the condition is false, it is not and a success is returned                                 $conditions2
   if the condition is false, a message can be added to the success result                        $conditions3
   'unless' can also be used to avoid negating the condition                                      $conditions4

 a matcher can applied if and only if a boolean condition is true
   if the condition is true, it is applied
     the result is true if the application is true                                                $conditions5
     the result is false if the application is false                                              $conditions6

   if the condition is false, it is applied
     the result is true if the application is false                                               $conditions7
     the result is false if the application is true                                               $conditions8

Custom
======

 a custom match can be negated, or used with be/have                                               $custom1
